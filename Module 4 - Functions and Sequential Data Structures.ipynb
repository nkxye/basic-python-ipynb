    "# Module 4: Functions and Sequential Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last module, we learned how to perform comparison and logical operations for **if-else statements** and **loops**. This time around, we’ll be focusing more on sequential data structures and functions in Python. We'll also get to know how **for** loops work with sequential data!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IMPORTANT**: Make sure to click on **Run** for **_each_ Code cell** to see the output and introduce functions and variables to the notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutable and Immutable Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deep diving into sequential data, it’s important for us to be able to, first, distinguish mutable from immutable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutable** means the object is **changeable** even after creation. **Immutable**, on the other hand, means the object **cannot be changed** once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as tiny houses on wheels versus houses built on lots. Tiny houses can be easily moved to another location, while houses built on lots can only be rebuilt, not moved. Tiny houses, in this case, would be mutable. Built houses, on the other hand, would be immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When coding, you need to consider the **immutability** of some sequential data structures. In Python, **mutable** objects include: \n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable** objects, on the other hand, include:\n",
    "- Numbers\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Frozen Sets\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    " \n",
    "Now, let’s get into this further and dive into mutable data structures!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve tried any other programming language, you might notice that the syntax for lists is similar to arrays. Each list is enclosed by square brackets ([]), while each element in the list is separated by commas. Lists are versatile in such a way that they can contain values of combined data types. Meaning, unlike the usual arrays, a list can have a combination of numerical, boolean, and string values. It can even accept **another data structure** as a **value**! For example, we have these lists declared:"

    "Do you need pizza to have an oven? The answer is no, you don’t. You can do other things with an oven, right? The same thing applies to functions. **Functions** are created to help **reuse blocks of code** for various purposes without having to type in the code over and over again, resulting in **code redundancy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s go ahead and create a **function** called **bake()**. First type in the **def** keyword, followed by the **function name**, which in this case is **bake**, then let’s put **open and close parentheses**. _Inside the **parentheses_**, we can put **one or more parameters**, which are **optional** values passed to the function. You can name this whatever you like, but again, let’s be as descriptive as possible with naming. With parameters, we can use whatever value/s we pass to perform necessary actions inside the function. For this example, we’re just printing the parameter, but we can add so much more to this block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, let’s add the r**eturn** keyword along with whatever value you’d want to use as a **return value**. Return values are comparable to the **values** we assign to **variables**. When we call variables, we get the values we assign to it. For **functions**, we get that **optional return value** every time we **call** it. When there’s **no return value** declared, the function **simply executes the lines of code** inside the function block. Let’s say your oven is on self-cleaning mode. You did not put anything inside to bake, so _you’re not expecting anything to come out of the oven._ It _simply does its job_, which is to clean itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s perform a function call by typing in the function name, which is **bake**, and inside the parentheses, let’s type in **“pizza”** as its **parameter**. Now, let’s go ahead and assign this then to a variable named **dinner**."
