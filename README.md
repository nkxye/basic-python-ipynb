# Basic Python Jupyter Notebook Modules

> The exercises for Modules 2 to 5 has a placeholder showing `# Enter your code here and click on Run to check the results` since these modules were initially created as _complimentary_ modules for learners who have already learned how to use Jupyter Notebook. Kindly disregard the placeholder and follow the exercise guidelines in a Pycharm IDE project (check out Module 1 for the installation guide).
