# Basic Python Jupyter Notebook Modules

ATMs, mobile phones, smart appliances and medical devices, even that one ad you’re seeing right now while browsing through your Facebook feed—did you know that all of those things exist today with the help of programming?

Programming languages and computing came a very long way. Computer scientists spent decades coming up with different programming languages to be used hand-in-hand with computers for advancement, innovation, and efficiency. In fact, there appears to be over 8,000 programming languages created from the 18th century to the present. Insane, right?

Now, people tend to think that you need to have an educational background in Computer Science or Information Technology in order to easily learn programming when, especially these days, it’s not really the case anymore! In fact, there’s been a rise in beginner-friendly languages, allowing people from other career paths to utilize the power of programming to aid them in their daily lives. Today, we're introducing you to one of the most widely-used and beginner-friendly programming languages out there: **Python**!

> The exercises for Modules 2 to 5 have a `# Enter your code here and click on Run to check the results` placeholder at the bottom since these modules were initially created as _complimentary_ modules for learners who have already learned how to use Jupyter Notebook. Kindly disregard the placeholder and feel free to do the exercises in a Pycharm IDE (or any other IDE) project.
